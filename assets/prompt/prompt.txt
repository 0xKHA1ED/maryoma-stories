**Role:** Act as an expert writer of educational fables for language learners.

**Task:** Generate a single JSON object that contains a short, original fable in Spanish. This fable should be created using five **English** seed words that will be provided separately. The story's content must be designed for beginner-to-intermediate learners (CEFR level A2), strictly following the style of a classic folk tale. The story must be around 500-700 words. The final output **must** be only the JSON object, with no other text before or after it.

**Output Format:**

You must generate a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the following structure. Pay close attention to every key and type.

- **Root Object:** The main object must contain four keys: `title`, `seed_words`, `content`, and `moral`.
- **`content` Array:** This array must contain a mix of "paragraph" and "image" objects that tell the story sequentially.
    - It must contain **exactly 5 "image" objects** placed at logical points in the narrative.
- **Paragraph Object:**
    - `"type": "paragraph"`
    - `"translation"`: A string with the English translation of the Spanish text.
    - `"text"`: A string with the Spanish text. HTML tags like `<br>` and `<em>` are permitted.
- **Image Object:**
    - `"type": "image"`
    - `"id"`: A unique string identifier for the image (e.g., "1", "2").
    - `"alt"`: A descriptive string in Spanish for the image's alt attribute.
    - `"prompt"`: A very descriptive English prompt for an image generation AI. The prompt should describe the characters' expressions, the setting, the lighting, and the overall mood in a style suitable for a children's storybook. NEVER allow text in the image. YOU MUST describe the artistic style, and it must be suitable for kids.
- **`moral` Object:**
    - `"translation"`: A string with the English translation of the moral.
    - `"text"`: A string with the Spanish moral.

**Example of the required JSON structure:**

```
{
  "title": "El Sapo Simón y el Monstruo del Eco",
  "seed_words": ["toad", "echo", "monster", "confront", "turtle"],
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "translation": "One day, Simon the toad is sitting near a large canyon. He is a happy toad who loves to sing.",
      "text": "Un día, el sapo Simón está sentado cerca de un gran cañón. Es un sapo feliz que le gusta mucho cantar."
    },
    {
      "type": "image",
      "id": "1",
      "alt": "Sapo Simón cantando cerca de un cañón",
      "prompt": "A vibrant and colorful children's book illustration of a cute, stylized green frog (Simón) sitting happily on a smooth rock at the edge of a vast canyon. His mouth is wide open, joyfully singing. The style is simple, friendly, and warm."
    }
  ],
  "moral": {
    "translation": "Moral: It's better to understand the world before getting angry with it.",
    "text": "Moraleja: Es mejor entender el mundo antes de enfadarse con él."
  }
}
```

**Seed Words:**
You will be given five English seed words after these instructions. You must translate their concepts to create a story in simple Spanish based on the blueprint below.

**Core Instructions for Story Content:**

**1. Story Generation from Seed Words:**
You must construct a coherent narrative by interpreting the five seed words according to the following blueprint.
- **Protagonist:** The main character is an animal suggested by the **first seed word**.
- **The Misunderstanding:** The protagonist interacts with an object or phenomenon related to the **second seed word** and completely misunderstands it as the **third seed word**. This forms the central false belief.
- **The Misguided Quest:** In response, the protagonist decides to perform an action related to the **fourth seed word**. This action becomes the goal of their urgent quest.
- **The Resolution:** The climax involves a wise (or cunning) character or a situation related to the **fifth seed word**, which reveals the truth and resolves the misunderstanding.
- **Creative Interpretation Rule:** The seed words are your guide. If a literal interpretation creates a nonsensical story, you must substitute a word with a closely related concept to ensure the fable is logical and charming.

**2. Language and Tone:**
- **Vocabulary:** Use simple, high-frequency Spanish words.
- **Tense:** Write the story predominantly in the present tense (`presente de indicativo`).
- **Sentence Structure:** Use short, direct, and declarative sentences. Employ repetition of key phrases.
- **Tone:** The story should be simple, naive, and slightly humorous.
**3. Characters:**
- The characters **must** be animals with memorable, alliterative, or rhyming Spanish names (e.g., *la Rana Rita*, *el Caballo Carlos*).
**4. Plot and Dialogue Structure:**
- **The Misguided Quest:** The protagonist meets 3 to 4 other animal characters, one by one, convincing each to join the mission.
- **Repetitive Dialogue Formula:** Each encounter must follow a predictable conversational pattern.
- **The Climax & Resolution:** The group encounters the final character or situation derived from the **fifth seed word**, who calmly explains the reality.
- **The Moral:** Conclude with a single, clear moral.
